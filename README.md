How do you start building it? Once You have download and installed Android Studio, you can start a new project with a activity template, the blank one to begin building the app. The first thing you will want to do is set up the layout for the game, A 9 square grid vertically on top and a play again button on button. Once the layout is figured out, you are good to go for the coding part.
